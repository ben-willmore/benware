== PLANS

* Work out how many samples we should actually expect from TDT, and set data buffer
  to the appropriate size. At the moment, we're messing with +/- because the TDT's
  algorithm isn't quite obvious. It can't be that hard either (ceil,floor or round)
* Once the above is fixed, get rid of nSamples from the saving code, and just save the 
  whole lot (which will no longer have a trailing zero)
* Store fs_in and fs_out in one of the data structures

* stereoPlay16bit
* More careful checks of device status in stim/dataDeviceIinit and ZBusInit
* Save expt structure somewhere
* UI for modifying expt structure
* UI for seeing incoming data

== DONE

* Grids for sparseness/highlights
* UI for choosing grid
* Why is having data as a {} faster than a []? This suggests that something
  can be fixed, and then it will be faster than both.
