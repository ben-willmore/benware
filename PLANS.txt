== PLANS

* stereoPlay16bit
* More careful checks of device status in stim/dataDeviceIinit and ZBusInit
* Save expt structure somewhere
* UI for modifying expt structure
* UI for seeing incoming data
* Why is having data as a {} faster than a []? This suggests that something
  can be fixed, and then it will be faster than both.


== DONE

* Grids for sparseness/highlights
* UI for choosing grid
